JQuery and Javascript libraries allow developers to use particular functions from that program and apply them to their own applications. Consider the schedule of a 9-5 work day and the events that may take place. The ability to source moment.js functions can create an application that can keep track of the events happening throughout the day. A daily planner will provide a user to manage time effectively through a busy schedule. The functions built within this application work as such:

- Using moment.js will provide the current date and time based on the user's location.
- Time blocks for a standard business day are listed as the user scrolls down
- Events that are entered for each hour can be saved.
- Each time block is color-coded based on past, present, and future events.

The image and link provided below will demonstrate the functions of the daily planner:
