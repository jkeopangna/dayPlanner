Third party APIs allow developers to fetch information from that server and apply them to their own applications. Consider the schedule of a 9-5 work day and the events that may take place. The ability to source third party APIs can create an application that can keep track of the events happening throughout the day. A daily planner will provide a user to manage time effectively through a busy schedule. The functions built within this application work as such:

- Using moment.js will provide the current date and time based on the user's location.
- Time blocks for a standard business day are listed as the user scrolls down
- Events that are entered for each hour can be saved.
- Each time block is color-coded based on past, present, and future events.

The image and link provided below will demonstrate the functions of the daily planner:
